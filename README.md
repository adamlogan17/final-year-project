# final-year-project

This is my final year project for my University degree, in Software Engineering at Queen's University Belfast.

The contents of the `Prototype` folder is the same as the `3068-prototype-submission` branch in this [repo](https://github.com/adamlogan17/svs-paediatric-delerium/tree/3068-prototype-submission)

The remaining files are the submission for the module CSC3068.

I am currently completing the module CSC3069, which is a continuation of the project.

As can be seen, the commits for the prototype are copied over, from the original repo, and this is done by following the instructions [here](https://deanmalone.net/post/how-to-fork-your-own-repo-on-github/)
